# System Design Document for Web Crawler

## 1. Requirements and Objectives

### Functional Requirements
- Crawl various websites to collect quotes.
- Extract quotes along with their references (authors, books, scholarly articles, etc.).
- Categorize quotes based on their source and context.
- Store the quotes in a structured database.
- Provide an interface to query and retrieve quotes based on different criteria.
- Ensure quotes are updated periodically to reflect new information.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability**: Ability to handle a large number of websites and quotes.
- **Reliability**: Ensure data integrity and minimize downtime.
- **Performance**: Efficient crawling and data extraction.
- **Maintainability**: Easy to update the crawler for new websites and data structures.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

1. **Web Crawler Module**
    - **Crawling Engine**: Responsible for fetching web pages.
    - **Parsing Engine**: Extracts quotes and references from the fetched pages.
    - **Scheduler**: Manages the crawling schedule to avoid overloading websites and respect robots.txt files.
    - **Politeness Policy**: Implement delays and respect rate limits to prevent IP bans.

2. **Data Processing Module**
    - **Data Extractor**: Processes raw HTML to identify and extract quotes.
    - **Data Cleaner**: Cleans and normalizes the extracted data.
    - **Categorizer**: Classifies quotes based on source and context using machine learning or rule-based approaches.
    - **Context Analyzer**: Understands and stores the context in which quotes are used.

3. **Storage Module**
    - **Database**: Stores quotes, references, and metadata. Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for structured data and a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) for flexibility and scalability.
    - **Search Index**: Enables efficient searching and retrieval of quotes (e.g., Elasticsearch, Apache Lucene(open source)).

4. **API Layer**
    - **RESTful API**: Provides endpoints for querying quotes based on different criteria.
    - **GraphQL API**: Optionally provide a GraphQL endpoint for more flexible queries.
    - **Admin Interface**: Allows for management and monitoring of the crawler and database.

5. **Frontend Module**
    - **Web Interface**: User-facing interface to search and browse quotes, available as a web app and browser extension.
    - **Browser Extension**: Highlights quotes in user documents and provides context from the database.

6. **Monitoring and Logging**
    - **Monitoring Tools**: Track the performance and health of the system (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
    - **Logging**: Record detailed logs for debugging and auditing using centralized logging.

## 3. Detailed Component Design

1. **Web Crawler Module**
    - **Crawling Engine**
        - Implement using frameworks like Scrapy (Python) or Colly (Go).
        - Use headless browsers like Puppeteer (Node.js) for rendering JavaScript-heavy pages.
        - Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms.
    - **Parsing Engine**
        - Use libraries like BeautifulSoup (Python) or Cheerio (Node.js) for HTML parsing.
        - Implement rules to handle different website structures and formats.

2. **Data Processing Module**
    - **Data Extractor**
        - Implement extraction logic using XPath or CSS selectors.
        - Use NLP techniques to identify and extract quotes accurately.
    - **Data Cleaner**
        - Normalize text data (e.g., removing special characters/whitespaces, fixing encoding issues).
        - Deduplicate quotes.
    - **Categorizer**
        - Use machine learning models to categorize quotes based on context and source.
        - Continuously improve categorization accuracy with feedback loops.
    - **Context Analyzer**
        - Use NLP to understand the context in which quotes are used.
        - Store context information alongside quotes for later retrieval.

3. **Storage Module**
    - **Database Schema**
        - Tables for Quotes, Authors, Books, Articles, Categories, and Metadata.
        - Use indexes for efficient querying.
    - **Search Index**
        - Use Elasticsearch for full-text search capabilities.
        - Regularly update the index with new data.

4. **API Layer**
    - **RESTful API**
        - Endpoints for querying quotes by author, book, article, category, context, etc.


5. **Frontend Module** 
    - **Web Interface**
        - Provide a user-friendly search and browsing experience.
    - **Browser Extension**
        - Develop a browser extension to highlight quotes in user documents and provide context.

6. **Monitoring and Logging** `Can be extended scope`
    - **Monitoring Tools**
        - Use Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization.
    - **Logging**
        - Implement centralized logging using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

## 4. Development and Deployment

1. **Development Workflow**
    - Use version control with Git.
    - Follow best practices for code quality (e.g., code reviews, automated testing).
    - Implement unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
    - Use code quality tools like linters and static analyzers.

2. **Deployment Strategy**
    - Use containerization with Docker for consistent environments.
    - Orchestrate containers with Kubernetes for scalability.
    - Implement CI/CD pipelines like Github Actions(Free).
    - Deploy on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean(cheaper option)) for scalability and reliability.

3. **Security Considerations**
    - Implement rate limiting and IP blocking to prevent abuse.
    - Secure API endpoints with authentication and authorization.
    - Ensure data is encrypted at rest and in transit.`(Because of data laws in some areas)`
   

## Additional Suggestions

1. Error Handling and Resilience
    - Implement robust error handling in all components to ensure the system can recover from failures gracefully.
    - Use lightweight message queues like RabbitMQ for decoupling components.
